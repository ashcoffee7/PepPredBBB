# PepPredBBB
Regeneron STS 2023 Project, Ashlyn Roice.
This is PepPredBBB, a machine-learning powered cheminformatics innovation to streamline and improve the effectiveness of the drug discovery process for neuropsychiatric drugs. Neurology and psychiatry are the fields of diseases with the lowest rates of efficacy for drug development, largely due to the inability to discover targets that cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB). PepPredBBB utilizes natural language processing and cheminformatics to tell whether any given peptide can cross the blood brain barrier, leading to the development of less toxic and more effective drugs for neuropsychiatric diseases.
